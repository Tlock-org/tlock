## What is Tlock

Tlock is an application-specific blockchain and decentralized social media platform that allows users to create profiles, content, connections directly on-chain. Anyone can access the pre-sorted content and interact via RPC of the chain, even if the front-end interface is unavailable.

Tlockâ€™s mission is to maximize the user experience of a fully decentralized social media platform, making it easy for Web2 and Web3 users to engage.

Inevitably, it introduces challenges including on-chain storage, token acquisition, Sybil attacks, indexing and Sorting which will be introduced in details. Tlock implements multiple alternative solutions to balance these challenges with decentralization.
